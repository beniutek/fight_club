== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.


We should not talk about the fight club but:

1. we use mini_magick, it needs to be installed to properly handle images see: https://github.com/minimagick/minimagick
and dont forget to `brew install imagemagick`

Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
